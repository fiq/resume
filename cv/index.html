            <p>
              I am a transformational technology leader with a track record of scaling high-growth SaaS platforms and leading distributed engineering teams across APAC. For over a decade, I have led the development and product evolution of high-profile, webscale products; scaling systems, optimising cost/performance, and achieving significant business impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              With strong expertise in cloud-native architecture, DevOps, security compliance, and software development, I lead platform and stream-aligned teams to excel using rapid learning loops, experimentation, and FinOps principles. I maintain a hands-on approach while leading, staying close to code, architecture decisions, and incident response.

            Raf actively worked on the approach he took and
            adopted a coaching stance with his teams, letting
            them own the solutions and outcomes, while working
            with them to up skill and create a better way. He's
            a thoughtful, intelligent individual who seeks the
            best for the people he's coaching; people definitely
            grow and flourish as a result of working with him.
