              For over a decade, I have led the development and product
              evolution of high-profile and webscale products; scaling systems,
              optimising cost/performance, and achieving significant revenue
              increases.

                            Raf actively worked on the approach he took and
                            adopted a coaching stance with his teams, letting
                            them own the solutions and outcomes, while working
                            with them to up skill and create a better way. He's
                            a thoughtful, intelligent individual who seeks the
                            best for the people he's coaching; people definitely
                            grow and flourish as a result of working with him.
